      <small>Security Breach Incident - X23: On ██/.██/██, SCP Site 19 breached by operatives from an organization known to the Foundation only as ‘The Serpent’s Hand’.</small>
        <small>Site-19 Breach: The breach of Site-19 seems to have been the second of two break-ins into SCP properties by ██████████, known to the Foundation as “L.S.” This individual was responsible for a previous security breach, having coordinated the theft of SCP-268. Though [DATA EXPUNGED], it is evident from video surveillance that SCP-268 was involved in this infiltration. The intruder known as L.S. seems to have simply walked into Site-19.</small>
        <small>The intrusion seems to have been for the purpose of using SCP-914. Knowledge of the intruder’s use of SCP-914 can only be assumed due to the intruders interruption of Dr. ██████ during routine testing. Dr. ██████ seems to have been [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the intrusion’s only personnel casualty.</small>
        <small> SCP-407 seems to have been deleted from the Foundation's system during this time, so it can only be assumed the individuals involved are responsible. Whether this means the file has been completely destroyed, or possibly in the hands of this rogue group, is unknown.</small>
